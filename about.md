 We were thinking about how easy it is for new programmers to get bogged down with the burden of new information that programming can bring. It is our endeavor to not only show Noobs that they can understand difficult concepts but that there is alot to be excited for. New trends, content, and tools that make programming the amazing journey that consistently rewards curiosity. Join us as we reduce difficult principles to simple concepts and as we share new things that excite us about web development.

We are [Riley Carrasquillo](https://twitter.com/portoreekan) (the noob) and [Adam Harris](https://twitter.com/adamCoder) (the not noob), we love web technology and we love talking about it! Feel free to reach out to us on Twitter and please rate and review the podcast if you like it.
